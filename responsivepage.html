    <p>Scroll to see the navigation bar change its background color.</p>
    <p>A landing page is a standalone web page designed with a specific purpose—typically to promote a product, capture leads, or guide a visitor to take a particular action. It’s often the first page a visitor sees after clicking a link from a search engine, advertisement, email, or social media post. Unlike a full website that includes multiple pages and navigation options, a landing page focuses on one clear message or goal, such as encouraging users to sign up for a newsletter, download a file, or learn more about a service.</p>
    <h2 id="features">Features</h2>
    <p>Feature description...</p>
    <p>A landing page is designed to be highly focused and goal-oriented, which is why it includes specific features that help convert visitors into leads or customers. One key feature is a strong, attention-grabbing headline that clearly communicates the value or purpose of the page. It usually follows up with a brief, compelling message or description that supports the headline and tells the visitor what to expect or why they should stay.</p>
    <h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2>
    <p>Pricing details...</p>
    <p>The pricing section of a landing page is one of its most critical components, especially if you're offering services, software, or digital products. It typically presents the different plans or packages you offer in a clear, structured format so that potential customers can easily compare features and choose the option that best suits their needs.</p>
    <h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>
    <p>Contact info...</p>
    <p>The contact section of a landing page provides visitors with a way to reach out for questions, support, or business inquiries. It typically appears at the bottom of the page and includes essential details such as a contact form, email address, phone number, and sometimes a physical address or embedded Google Map if location is relevant.</p>
